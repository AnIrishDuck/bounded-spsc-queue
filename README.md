## NOTE

I have modified this to work with my local version of rustc / cargo:

```
DIAG> cargo --version
cargo 0.2.0-nightly (83a6d0e 2015-04-16) (built 2015-04-16)
DIAG> rustc --version
rustc 1.0.0-beta.3 (5241bf9c3 2015-04-25) (built 2015-04-25)

```

I know, I know. I should be using the 1.0 release already. Sue me.
